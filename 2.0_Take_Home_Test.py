HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: Aidan A. Kugley

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
#use a hashtag to do a single line comment


INCORRECT: What does floor do? 3/2 is not square rooting
2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3 0.6666666666666666 this formula is for dividing
2 // 3 0 this is the floor formula
3/2 1.5 this formula is for square rooting
3//2 1 this cuts off everything from decimal on





3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b
the formula doesnt work due to a not being defined because we used a capital A




INCORRECT, The best one would describe what it's used for.
4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area this one
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle




INCORRECT. The ones with symbols or periods can't be used either.
5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

1Apple cant be used
account# cant be used
total% cant be used
#left cant be used
cant be used because they start with numbers at the front or symbols and periods






6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2  i think it will equal 2
a*=10 i thknk it will be 20
a/=2 i think it will be 10
a-=7 i think it will be 3
a+=5 this will be 15
a it will be 15
type(a) <class 'float'>







7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area







8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42) int
type(42.0) float
type("C3PO") str
type(True) bool







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)
a
use a * before the () because () on its own doesnt work





10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave
should be ave=(x+y+z)/3
